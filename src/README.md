# OCaml parsing code

This directory contains several versions of the code described in
"Simple, functional, sound and complete parsing for all context-free
grammars".

  * [core.ml             ](core.ml) - The basic parser
  * [main.ml             ](main.ml) - The standard entry point, outputs compact forms


In addition, there is the following bonus:

  * [earley.ml           ](earley.ml) - OCaml version of Earley parsing, handles eps rules correctly
